OOP Track Overview
===============================================
Prerequisites
-----
* Comfortable with programming in PHP itself
* Basic knowledge og working with a database

After this track, what will we level be!
-----
* We'll be ready to bring object-oriented coding into us projecs immediately.
* We'll be able to comfortable apply all the OO basics, like creating classes, handling properties and methods, visibility and instantiating objects.
* Beyond just using classes, the idea of 'dependency injection' will be clear
* For organization, the idea of a 'dependency injection container' will be clearing, allowing 
we to create many objects, but keep them organized.
* We'll feel comfortable applying more advanced ideas, like abstract classes and interfaces.

Object Oriented Ship Battling, Ahem Programming test
===============================================

This repository holds the screencast code, script and blueprints for a
secret rebel base for the [Object Oriented Series](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/oo)
from KnpUniversity.

Setup
-----

To get this code working, open your favorite terminal application
and start the built-in web server:

```bash
cd /path/to/the/project
php -S localhost:8000
```

This command will appear to "hang" - but that's perfect! You're
now running a temporary PHP web server (press ctrl+c to stop it
when you're done later).

Pull up the new site by going to:

    http://localhost:8000
